Welcome to our COMS3015 Graphics Assignment.

Run "make speedy" from command-line to start the render.

There is an outlined section at the start of RedNoise.cpp to play with various settings i.e. AA and Reflections.

- Rendering Types:
    - Press 1 for Wireframe.
    - Press 2 for Rasterize.
    - Press 3 for Raytracer.

- Animations - pressing these will reset and reload the scene.
    - Press 8 for the Wireframe Animation.
    - Press 9 for the Rasterize Animation.
    - Press 0 for the Raytraced Animation.

- Movement around scene:
    - Arrow Keys - Camera Movement.
    - a/d - Pan.
    - w/z - Tilt.

- Recordings & Snapshots:
    - r - Recording - Start/Stop recording consequent rendered frames into a PPM sequence.
    - n - Snapshot - save this current frame in the PPM sequence.

"Welcome to the Computer Graphics unit. This unit will focus primarily on rendering - the process of creating “realistic” images from geometry data. This unit does not intend to teach specific graphics APIs (such as OpenGL or DirectX), but rather will explore the fundamental principles and practices that underlie such libraries. The nature of the unit is such that the understanding gained from investigating these fundamental principles and practices will give students a deep understanding of how such APIs operate. As a result of this, students will have the knowledge and insight that will enable them to gain an appreciation of (and rapidly become proficient in) any relevant graphics framework."
