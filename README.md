#COMS3015 Computer Graphics

"Welcome to the Computer Graphics unit. This unit will focus primarily on rendering - the process of creating “realistic” images from geometry data. This unit does not intend to teach specific graphics APIs (such as OpenGL or DirectX), but rather will explore the fundamental principles and practices that underlie such libraries. The nature of the unit is such that the understanding gained from investigating these fundamental principles and practices will give students a deep understanding of how such APIs operate. As a result of this, students will have the knowledge and insight that will enable them to gain an appreciation of (and rapidly become proficient in) any relevant graphics framework."
